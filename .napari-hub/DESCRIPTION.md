napari-chatgpt brings **Omega**, an autonomous LLM-powered agent for interactive, conversational image processing and analysis directly within the napari viewer.

Omega leverages Large Language Models (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) through the [LiteMind](https://github.com/royerlab/litemind) library to understand natural-language requests and translate them into image processing workflows, napari widgets, and analysis pipelines.

**Key capabilities:**

- Write and execute image processing code from natural language
- Create custom napari widgets on the fly
- Perform classic and deep-learning segmentation (Otsu, watershed, Cellpose, StarDist)
- Control the napari viewer (camera, layers, rendering)
- Search the web, download files, install packages
- Discover and use any installed napari plugin
